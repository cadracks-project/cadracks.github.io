The context
-----------

CAD, CAM, CAE has historically been dominated by big commercial players. Yet, some Open Source 
initiatives are becoming more and more credible and their capabilities start to 
compete with the big players in some areas. Some Open Source initiatives are even 
on par with the commercial solutions in specific areas:
- FreeCAD for parametric geometry;
- Open Cascade as a CAD kernel;
- solvespace as a constraints solver

Yet, big players also offer the possibility to work as a team on projects more complex 
than hobby level.


CadRacks
--------

The goal of CadRacks is to bring the team working functionalities to Open Hardware projects. 
By assembling the best bits from the Open Source world, we believe we can offer a great tool at zero cost!

Our vision is to create an Open Hardware projects hub where engineers/innovators/enthusiasts can contribute 
from anywhere in the world, at any time, with any CAD software.
